# Frequently Asked Questions

## How is hdoc licensed?

hdoc is available under the [AGPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).
Commercial licensing is also available through the Enterprise plan.

## Can I use hdoc without creating an account?

hdoc can be used independently of the [hdoc.io](https://hdoc.io/) service.
Users can compile their own binaries by following the instructions at hdoc's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hdoc/hdoc).
Self-compiled binaries produce HTML files suitable for self-hosting.

Using hdoc.io has several advantages:
1. Pre-compiled fully-static binaries are provided, simplifying deployment
2. Free hosting on [docs.hdoc.io](https://docs.hdoc.io/)
3. Hosting is backed by a global CDN

Lastly, we ask that those using hdoc for commercial purposes support hdoc's development financially by purchasing a license or hosting plan.
For those users, we provide support and priority service.

## Do you offer private hosting?

The only option for private hosting is currently the Enterprise plan.
Private hosting on [docs.hdoc.io](http://docs.hdoc.io) is currently under consideration for other plans.

## Do you offer hosting on custom domains?

The only option for custom domains is currently the Enterprise plan.
Hosting documentation on a custom domain is currently under consideration for other plans.
